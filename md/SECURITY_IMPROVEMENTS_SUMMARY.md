## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

The following environment variables have been added to support the security features:

#### Security Configuration
```bash
SECURITY_ENABLE_AUDIT_LOGGING=true
SECURITY_ENABLE_RATE_LIMITING=true
SECURITY_ENABLE_TOKEN_VALIDATION=true
SECURITY_ENABLE_FILE_ACCESS_CONTROL=true
SECURITY_ENABLE_FILE_SCANNING=true
SECURITY_ENABLE_VIRUS_SCANNING=false
SECURITY_MAX_FILE_SIZE_FOR_SCANNING_MB=10
```

#### Rate Limiting
```bash
RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE=100
RATE_LIMIT_MAX_DOWNLOADS_PER_HOUR=20
RATE_LIMIT_MAX_DOWNLOADS_PER_DAY=100
```

#### External Logging Services
```bash
# Sentry
NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN=your_sentry_dsn
SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT=development
SENTRY_TRACES_SAMPLE_RATE=0.1
SENTRY_PROFILES_SAMPLE_RATE=0.1

# LogRocket
LOGROCKET_APP_ID=your_logrocket_app_id
LOGROCKET_ENABLE=false

# Datadog
DATADOG_API_KEY=your_datadog_api_key
DATADOG_ENABLE=false
DATADOG_SERVICE=booksweeps

# New Relic
NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=your_new_relic_license_key
NEW_RELIC_ENABLE=false
NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=booksweeps
```

### Setup Script

A setup script has been created to automatically configure environment variables:

```bash
npm run setup:security
```

This script will:
- Create `.env.local` if it doesn't exist
- Add all necessary environment variables with default values
- Provide helpful comments and descriptions
- Guide you through the next steps

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

### 1. Content Security Policy (CSP)
- **Nonce-based script execution**: Each request gets a unique nonce for inline scripts
- **Removed unsafe-eval**: Eliminates XSS vulnerabilities from eval() usage
- **Comprehensive directives**: Covers all content types with appropriate restrictions

### 2. File Security
- **Magic number validation**: Validates file types by their binary signatures
- **Content analysis**: Scans for suspicious patterns in file content
- **Risk assessment**: Categorizes files as low/medium/high risk
- **Automatic blocking**: Rejects high-risk files automatically

### 3. Request Monitoring
- **Pattern detection**: Identifies suspicious request patterns
- **Security event logging**: Tracks all security-related events
- **Correlation tracking**: Links related events across the application
- **Performance monitoring**: Tracks slow requests and performance issues

### 4. Error Handling
- **Structured logging**: Consistent error format with context
- **External service integration**: Sends errors to monitoring services
- **Security event tracking**: Special handling for security-related errors
- **Request tracing**: Full request lifecycle tracking

## üìä Monitoring and Logging

### Log Levels
- **CRITICAL**: Security violations, authentication failures
- **HIGH**: Authorization issues, rate limit violations
- **MEDIUM**: Validation errors, suspicious patterns
- **LOW**: Not found errors, external service issues

### External Services
The system supports multiple external logging services:

1. **Sentry**: Error tracking and performance monitoring
2. **LogRocket**: Session replay and user experience tracking
3. **Datadog**: Metrics and infrastructure monitoring
4. **New Relic**: Application performance monitoring

### Security Events
The following security events are automatically logged:
- CSRF token validation failures
- Unauthorized access attempts
- Suspicious request patterns
- File security violations
- Authentication failures
- Rate limit violations

## üöÄ Usage

### Basic Setup
1. Run the setup script: `npm run setup:security`
2. Review and customize `.env.local`
3. Add external service API keys if desired
4. Validate configuration: `npm run security:validate`

### Validation
The configuration validation script checks:
- Required environment variables
- Valid rate limiting values
- External service configuration
- Security feature compatibility

### Monitoring
- Check console logs for security events
- Monitor external service dashboards
- Review performance metrics
- Track security incident trends

## üîç Testing

### Security Testing
- Test file upload with malicious content
- Attempt unauthorized access to protected routes
- Test rate limiting with excessive requests
- Verify CSP headers are properly set

### Performance Testing
- Monitor request duration logs
- Check for slow request alerts
- Verify correlation ID tracking
- Test external service integration
