# IP Address Fix Implementation

## Problem
The download system was using a hardcoded IP address (`127.0.0.1`) instead of capturing the real client IP address. This prevented proper analytics and security tracking.

## Solution
Implemented a comprehensive IP address detection system that works across different deployment environments (Netlify, Cloudflare, etc.).

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Shared Utility Function
**File:** `lib/utils.ts`
- Added `getClientIP()` function that handles multiple IP header scenarios
- Supports `x-forwarded-for`, `x-real-ip`, and `cf-connecting-ip` headers
- Provides fallback to 'unknown' if no IP can be detected

### 2. Updated Download API Route
**File:** `app/api/reader-magnets/downloads/route.ts`
- Removed dependency on client-provided IP address
- Now extracts real IP from request headers using `getClientIP()`
- Added user agent tracking for better analytics
- Updated database insertion to use real IP and user agent

### 3. Updated Entries API Route
**File:** `app/api/entries/route.ts`
- Added IP address tracking to campaign entries
- Uses the same `getClientIP()` utility function
- Added user agent tracking for consistency

### 4. Updated Frontend
**File:** `app/dl/[slug]/page.tsx`
- Removed hardcoded IP address from request body
- Server now automatically detects IP from request headers

## IP Detection Priority
The system checks headers in this order:
1. `x-forwarded-for` - Most common with proxies/CDNs
2. `x-real-ip` - Used by some reverse proxies
3. `cf-connecting-ip` - Cloudflare specific
4. Fallback to 'unknown' if none found

## Benefits
- ✅ Real IP addresses are now captured for analytics
- ✅ Works across different deployment environments
- ✅ Improved security tracking
- ✅ Better user behavior analytics
- ✅ Consistent IP tracking across all API endpoints

## Testing
A test function `testIPDetection()` is available in `lib/utils.ts` for verifying the IP detection logic.

## Deployment Notes
- Works with Netlify (current deployment)
- Compatible with Cloudflare
- Supports standard reverse proxy configurations
- No changes needed to frontend code
